OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT: DATA PROCESSING

Before applying AI algorithms, data preprocessing is a vital step that ensures the data's quality, consistency, and suitability for analysis. This process involves a series of tasks aimed at refining raw data, which is often incomplete, noisy, or unstructured, into a form that can be effectively used by AI models. Preprocessing is critical because poor-quality data can lead to inaccurate or misleading model outcomes.
KEY COMPONENTS:

Data Cleaning: Raw data can contain errors such as missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies. The goal of data cleaning is to identify and correct these issues to improve the quality of the dataset. Techniques used in data cleaning include:

Handling missing data: By either imputing missing values, removing rows/columns, or using algorithms that can manage missing data.
Removing duplicates: Ensures that redundant or repetitive entries are eliminated.
Correcting errors: Fixing or removing incorrect or outlier data that may skew analysis.
Data Transformation: Once the data is cleaned, it often needs to be transformed into a format that can be readily used by AI algorithms. This can involve:

Normalization/Standardization: Ensuring that numerical data is on a similar scale, which helps some algorithms perform better.
Encoding categorical variables: Converting non-numeric data (such as categorical data) into a numerical format that models can process, often using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Training set: Used to train the AI model.
Validation set: Used to tune model hyperparameters and validate its performance during training.
Test set: A separate set used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance after training to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
This step is crucial to avoid overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.
